## 👋 Hi, I’m @dwilliams-gs  
### Senior QA Automation Engineer at [Gymshark](https://github.com/gymshark)

I specialise in building **scalable, reliable automation frameworks** embedded directly into modern product codebases.  
Currently focused on **Playwright with TypeScript**, following our transition away from Selenium to a faster, more maintainable testing strategy aligned with modern web development.

---

## 🧪 Current Focus

- **Playwright + TypeScript**  
  Designing and maintaining end-to-end test frameworks embedded within the main website codebase, aligned with developer workflows.

- **Modern Test Architecture**  
  Improving test readability, maintainability, and scalability through strong typing, clear abstractions, and consistent coding standards.

- **Reducing Test Flakiness**  
  Applying Playwright-native strategies (auto-waits, tracing, retries where appropriate) to improve reliability across environments.

- **CI/CD Test Integration**  
  Ensuring automated tests provide fast, meaningful feedback within CI pipelines while clearly demonstrating product quality.

- **Test Observability & Visibility**  
  Enhancing how test results, failures, and trends are surfaced to engineering teams for faster decision-making.

## 🌱 What I’m Exploring & Learning

- **Retry Logic in Functional Testing**  
  When retries help vs when they hide real issues — and how to implement them responsibly.

- **Automation in Fast-Moving Codebases**  
  Adapting test strategies to rapidly evolving features without slowing delivery.

- **Cloud-Based Cross-Browser Testing**  
  Running POCs with LambdaTest to evaluate scalability and CI compatibility.

- **Mobile Testability (iOS & Android)**  
  Improving app testability and evaluating modern mobile automation approaches.
